# GTA SA 3D Skins

## Summary
GTA San Andreas 3D Skins is a web app where users can view all the GTA San Andreas characters in 3D with orbital controls. The character models were in a proprietary format, so, to convert them to a web compatible format, Python was used to control Blender and automate more than 300 exports. Three.js, React.js and Sass were used for the front-end while Node.js and Postgres were used in the back-end.
